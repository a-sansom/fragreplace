A module to demonstrate a menu item returning a fragment of HTML, such as a
form, not a entire themed page of markup.

To see the working example, go to:

  http://<your-site>/fragreplace/page

To see the fragment of markup that will be inserted in the page, go to:

  http://<your-site>/fragreplace/fragment

Module uses javascript, so you need to have that enabled in your browser for the
module example to work properly.
